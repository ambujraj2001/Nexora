## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- A Supabase project and API keys.

### 2. Environment Setup

#### Backend (`/biz-flow`)

Create a `.env` file in the `biz-flow` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

#### Frontend (`/client`)

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Installation

From the project root:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd biz-flow && npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 4. Running the Project

Open two terminal windows/tabs:

**Terminal 1: Backend**

```bash
cd biz-flow
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Frontend**

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📖 Main Modules

### **New Conversation**

The core interaction area. Type or use **Voice Input** (WebSpeech API) to communicate with your AI assistant.

### **Settings (Profile & AI)**

A comprehensive module to manage your identity and AI behavior:

- **Tone**: Professional, Casual, Technical, or Concise.
- **Complexity**: 5 levels of response depth (Simple → Expert).
- **Security**: Manage your identity and clear context memory.

### **Security Model**

During signup, the system generates a unique **Master Access Code** (e.g., `AI-XXXX-XXXX`). This code is your only way to login. **Store it safely!**
